### Using Render

  <img src="https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Render" height=32>
</a>

Note that sample data does not automatically get loaded when deploying to Render with the default configuration. In order to add sample data, run the following commands in the web service shell:
```shell
bundle exec rails db:seed
bundle exec rake spree_sample:load
```

#### Deploying to Render with Spree Legacy Frontend
To deploy to render with the Spree Legacy Frontend, first follow the instructions in the [legacy frontend ReadMe](https://github.com/spree/spree_legacy_frontend#installation) on adding the appropriate gems to your gemfile, and update the web service build command to use `bin/render-build-legacy-frontend.sh`, like so:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: spree
    env: ruby
    buildCommand: "./bin/render-build-legacy-frontend.sh"
```

After that, you'll be ready to deploy to render.

## Troubleshooting

### libvips error

If you are building the application using the latest code, you may encounter the following libvips error:
```
LoadError: Could not open library 'vips.so.42'
```
This error is usually an indication that you do not have libvips installed locally on your machine. Check that libvips is installed with `vips -v`, and if it is not installed, follow [installation instructions here](https://www.libvips.org/install.html).

### disabled 'Add to Cart' button

This issue is specific to running with [spree_legacy_frontend](https://github.com/spree/spree_legacy_frontend).
